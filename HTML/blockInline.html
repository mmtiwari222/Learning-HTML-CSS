    <h1>Here, We study about Block & Inline Elements</h1>

    <!-- all html elements are by default either a block or inline element -->

    <!-- block elements - are elements that take up the full width of the page and start on a new line -->
    <!-- Examples of block elements are: h1, h2, h3, p, div, ul, li -->
    <p>This is a Block Element</p>


    <!-- inline elements - are elements that take up only the space needed for their content and are displayed on the same line, does not start on a new line, unless after a block element -->
    <!-- Examples of inline elements are: <a> <img> <span> <input> -->
    <span>This is a Inline Element</span>

    <!-- nesting inline and block elements -->
    <!-- Inline elements are not allowed to contain block-level elements, It can only contain inline elements -->
    <!-- block elements are not allowed to contain inline elements and also contain other block elements  -->
