    <!-- Audio Tag - audio tag is used to embed audio in HTML
     attributes: src, controls -->
    <!-- src - attribute is used to specify the source of the audio -->
    <!-- control - attribute is used to add controls to the audio -->
    <audio src="./music.mp3" controls></audio>
    <br />

    <!-- Video Tag - video tag is used to embed video in HTML -->
    <video src="./video.mp4" controls></video>
    <!-- Customizing Controls with Attributes
    You can customize the behavior of the <audio> and <video> elements using additional attributes:

Common Attributes for Both <audio> and <video>
Attribute	Description
controls	Displays the default media controls (play, pause, volume, etc.).
autoplay	Automatically starts playing the media as soon as it is ready.
loop	Loops the media playback indefinitely.
muted	Mutes the audio by default.
preload	Specifies how the media should be loaded (auto, metadata, none).
src	Specifies the URL of the media file.

Attributes Specific to <video>
Attribute	Description
poster	Specifies an image to display as a placeholder before the video plays.
width	Sets the width of the video player.
height	Sets the height of the video player.
playsinline	Ensures the video plays inline on mobile devices (instead of fullscreen). -->

    <!-- source tag - source tag is used to specify the source of the video & audio -->
    <!-- When to Use Which?
   Use the src attribute:
   When you only have one media file format.
    When you don't need to worry about browser compatibility.

   Use the <source> tag:
   When you want to provide multiple formats for better compatibility.
   When you want to ensure your media works across all browsers. -->
