<!-- HTML Overview
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a
webpage using a series of elements and tags.

Tags and Elements
Tags: Tags are the building blocks of HTML. They are used to create elements. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>).
    Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag (<tag>) and a closing tag (</tag>).
    Elements: An element is a complete set of tags and the content within them. For example, <p>Hello World!</p> is a
    paragraph element. -->

    <!-- Self-Closing Tags
    Self-closing tags are HTML tags that do not require a closing tag. They are used for elements that do not have any
    content. These tags are written with a slash before the closing angle bracket. Examples of self-closing tags include: -->



    <!-- <hr> and <br> Tags
    <hr> (Horizontal Rule): This tag is used to insert a horizontal line across the webpage. It is a self-closing tag and does not require a closing tag.
    <br> (Line Break): This tag is used to insert a line break in the text. It is also a self-closing tag and does not
    require a closing tag. -->
